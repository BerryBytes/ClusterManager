# 📝 Submitting Issues

## Help Us Help You!

{: .subtitle }

Issues are a perfect way to request a feature/enhancement or report a suspected bug. We use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/01cloud/ClusterManager/issues) to track issues in ClusterManager.

The process of sorting and resolving issues is a significant task that requires careful attention. To help our maintainers (and community members) quickly understand your issue, please follow the guidelines below to provide clear and helpful details.

---

## 🚨 **Getting Help Vs Reporting an Issue**

> **Important**: The issue tracker is not a general support forum. It’s designed for **bug reports** and **feature requests** only.

If you have end-user support questions, please consider using the [ClusterManager Community Forum](https://community.ClusterManager.io/) to get help from fellow users and the community.

## 🖋️ **Issue Title**

- **Keep the title short and descriptive** (~60 characters).
- The title should help others quickly understand what the issue is about.

### Examples:

- 🐛 **Bug**: Duplicate requests in access logs
- 💡 **Feature**: Support TCP

---

## 💡 **Feature Request**

ClusterManager is an open-source project, and our goal is to be the best edge router possible.

When requesting new features, please ensure they have broad utility and aren’t limited to edge case scenarios. For more effective feature requests, follow these steps:

1. **Use the [issue template](https://github.com/01cloud/ClusterManager/)** to provide consistent and detailed information.
2. Explain **why** the feature is important and how it will improve ClusterManager for everyone.
3. Share specific **use cases** that demonstrate the value of the feature.
4. Features with more **positive interactions** (e.g., claps, +1s, discussion) help us prioritize based on community demand.
5. If you’re willing to create a **Pull Request (PR)** for your feature, mention it in the issue. This helps us plan and integrate it more smoothly.

## 🐞 **Bug Reports or Issues**

For bug reports, follow the [issue template](https://github.com/ClusterManager/ClusterManager/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml) as closely as possible.

### Key things to include:

- **Conditions**: What were the circumstances when you encountered the issue? What was your setup/environment?
- **Logs**: Include relevant logs that can help us identify the problem.
- **Reproduction Steps**: Provide clear steps to reproduce the issue so we can investigate effectively.

**Be clear and concise**: Help us quickly understand your problem. Polish your message to make it easy for others to read and respond to.

To improve readability, follow [GitHub Markdown Syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github) for better formatting.

## 🌍 **International English**

Remember, not all maintainers or ClusterManager users are native English speakers. If you feel that some messages come across as rude, it’s likely due to a language barrier. We all share the common goal of improving ClusterManager and appreciate your understanding and patience!
